# Finding Donors for CharityML

This project aims to predict individuals' income using supervised learning algorithms based on data from the 1994 U.S. Census. The goal is to accurately predict whether an individual makes more than $50,000, which can help organizations like CharityML in soliciting donations effectively.

## Overview

In this project, we employ several supervised algorithms to model individuals' income and choose the best candidate algorithm based on preliminary results. We then further optimize this algorithm to achieve the best model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker. It consists of features such as age, education level, and workclass, and the target variable is whether an individual earns more than $50,000 annually.


## Python Version

Make sure you have Python 3.9 installed on your machine to run the code.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
